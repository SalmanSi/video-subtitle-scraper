# 1-4 Parallel Scraping

## Objective
Run N concurrent workers (configurable) to process video queue safely, with atomic job claiming, retry logic (exponential backoff), and graceful shutdown.

## TRD Reference
Section 1.4 Parallel Scraping; plus queue rules (1.2) and subtitle scraping (1.3).

## Worker Model
- Master process starts `max_workers` background tasks (threads or processes). Simplicity: start threads due to SQLite serialized writes & network-bound workload.
- Each worker loop: claim -> process -> sleep minimal -> repeat.

## Configuration Source
`settings` singleton row: `max_workers`, `max_retries`, `backoff_factor`.

## Worker Loop (Pseudocode)
```python
STOP_EVENT = threading.Event()

def worker_loop(name: str):
    while not STOP_EVENT.is_set():
        video_id = claim_next_video(conn())
        if not video_id:
            time.sleep(1)  # idle backoff
            continue
        try:
            process_video(video_id)
        except TransientError as e:
            schedule_retry(video_id, e)
        except PermanentError as e:
            mark_failed(video_id, str(e))
```

## Retry & Backoff
```python
def schedule_retry(video_id, err):
    attempts = increment_attempts(video_id)
    max_r = get_settings().max_retries
    if attempts >= max_r:
        mark_failed(video_id, f"Exceeded retries: {err}")
        return
    delay = get_settings().backoff_factor ** attempts
    time.sleep(delay)  # simple inline backoff (could enqueue timestamp)
    reset_status_to_pending(video_id)
```

## Graceful Shutdown
- Signal handlers (SIGINT, SIGTERM) set STOP_EVENT, workers finish current video then exit.
- On startup perform recovery: `UPDATE videos SET status='pending' WHERE status='processing';`

## Atomic Claim Strategy
See task 1-2. Each worker uses single transaction update to transition `pending` -> `processing`.

## Concurrency Concerns
- SQLite serialized writers; keep transactions short.
- Most time spent waiting on network (yt-dlp); release DB connection during network fetch (avoid long transactions).

## Monitoring
- Maintain in-memory structure of active workers {worker_name: video_id, started_at}.
- Broadcast via WebSocket `/jobs/status` every 1s.
- Persist job summary in `jobs` table: status `running`, `active_workers` count.

## Edge Cases
1. No pending videos -> workers idle quickly (low CPU usage) with backoff.
2. Worker exception before marking status -> on restart row resets.
3. Increase workers via settings -> require restart or dynamic spawn.
4. Very large queue (10k) -> selection still O(1) due to indexed ordered selection.
5. Long-lasting transient errors -> exponential backoff prevents tight loop.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Running with `max_workers=5` processes videos concurrently (observe faster completion vs single worker).
- No video processed more than once.
- Graceful Ctrl+C leaves no rows stuck in `processing`.
- Retry attempts visible via `attempts` field.

## Definition of Done
- Worker module implemented with tests for claim exclusivity and retry exhaustion.
- Signal handling validated manually.
- WebSocket reflects active worker count.

## IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY - TASK 1-4 PARALLEL SCRAPING

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION (August 20, 2025)

This task has been **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** with comprehensive parallel scraping capabilities that exceed the original requirements.

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Implemented**

#### Enhanced Worker System (`src/workers/worker.py`)
- **SubtitleWorker Class**: Individual worker with exponential backoff and error classification
- **WorkerManager Class**: Manages N concurrent workers with graceful shutdown
- **Signal Handling**: SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers for production deployment
- **Startup Recovery**: Automatic detection and recovery of stuck videos

#### Core Features Delivered

**1. Configurable Concurrent Workers**
```python
# Supports 1-20 workers based on settings table
worker_manager = WorkerManager(num_workers=5)
worker_manager.start()  # Starts 5 concurrent threads
```

**2. Atomic Job Claiming**
```sql
-- SQLite atomic transaction prevents race conditions
UPDATE videos 
SET status = 'processing'
WHERE id = :video_id AND status = 'pending'
```

**3. Exponential Backoff Implementation**
```python
def get_retry_delay(attempts, backoff_factor):
    return min(backoff_factor ** attempts, 300)  # Cap at 5 minutes

# Example: 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, 32.0 seconds...
```

**4. Enhanced Error Classification**
- **Permanent Errors**: "No subtitles available", "Video unavailable", "Private video"
- **Transient Errors**: "Connection timeout", "Rate limit", "Service unavailable"
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Only retry transient errors with backoff

**5. Graceful Shutdown System**
```python
# Signal handlers ensure clean shutdown
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)
signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal_handler)

# Workers finish current video before stopping
# Processing videos reset to 'pending' on shutdown
```

### üîß **Enhanced API Endpoints**
